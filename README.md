## Task II

I've tried to keep the text aligned as much as possible, but due to the sub-pixel problem, it may feel awry, especially when you zoom in. Would've preferred an SVG or PNG perhaps, for that pixel-perfect goodness :rainbow: .

Tested on Chromium 69.0 and Firefox 62.0.

Hope I did a good job. :smile:
